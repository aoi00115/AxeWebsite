        <p>This is a fanpage of AXE and LYNX deodorant to introduce<br>
          every single scent ever produced in the past to this day. Some of<br>
          the AXE / LYNX deodorant have been discontinued and unobtainable,<br>
          so we came up with the idea of making a website that features the<br>
          legendary scent and design that have once existed as some sort of<br>
          tribute.</p>

        <p>Axe was launched in France in 1983 by Unilever. It was inspired by<br>
          another of Unilever's brands, Impulse. Unilever introduced many<br>
          products in the range, but were forced to use the name Lynx in<br>
          the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia,and New Zealand due to<br>
          trademark issues with the Axe name. In addition, some countries<br>
          (such as South Africa) introduced the brand as EGO. Scents have<br>
          evolved over time. From 1983 until about 1989, the variant names were<br>
          descriptions of the fragrances and included Musk, Spice, Amber,<br>
          Oriental, and Marine. From 1990 until 1996, geographic names for<br>
          fragrances were used. In 2009, the brand launched an eight-centimetre<br>
          container called the Axe Bullet. The brand has also extended<br>
          into other areas.</p>
